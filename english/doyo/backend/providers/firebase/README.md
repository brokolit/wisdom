# Set up
To integrate Firebase, the following parameters are used:
  
  
| Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Private Key | Private key of the Google service account |
| Service Account Email | Email of the Google service account |
| Project ID | ID of the project in Firebase |

These values are obtained from the project configuration in Firebase. The 'project ID' can be found in the 'General' tab.

To obtain the private key and service account email, you need to go to the 'Service Accounts' tab and look for the 'Generate new private key' button. This will download a JSON file that contains both the private key and the service account email.
