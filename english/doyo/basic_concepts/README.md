# How are projects structured?

Doyo projects contain:

- JSON files
- Folders
- Resources

### JSON Files

JSON files are just plain text files that have the information organized using some rules. These files are used in Doyo to define the whole application: the user interface, the behavior, the options, etc.

A proeject contains several JSON files, used for different purposes: screens, menus, dialogs, etc.


### Folders

Folders help you organize the different JSON files and resources.

The root folder only contains the main JSON file (app.json), which includes general setup information about the application. Besides that file, it contains some specific folders that contain the rest of JSON files and resources of the project. These folders must follow a predefined naming, which might vary depending on the type of project we're building (mobile app, website, script, etc.).


### Resources

Besides the JSON files, a project contains resource files, which are the content of the app (photos, audio files, videos, databases, etc.).
