# Certicates folder

This folder is only needed in case you want to use your own certificate to sign the app. For example, if you want to use Doyo to build and old app that made with another platform and published on GooglePlay, you'll need to use the same certificate that was used the first time. If you don't want to use your own certifica, Doyo will generate a random certificate for each app.

For android, you can use a java keystore file. You can get your own keystore using the app Keytool that comes with all Java distributions.
